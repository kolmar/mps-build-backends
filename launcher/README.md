This is a simple Gradle plugin for configuring the right Java toolchain and command line flags for a specific
MPS version.

It is not published to a repository for now and is only used in the integration tests. After incubating for a while,
the goal is to have it published so that it can be used by Gradle plugins that execute the backends.
